## 🚀 How to Use

### Prerequisites
- MySQL Server installed
- MySQL Workbench or any SQL client

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ishikadubey1105/SQL-BASICS.git
   cd SQL-BASICS
   ```

2. **Create the database**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE store_db;
   USE store_db;
   ```

3. **Create and populate the table**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE products (
       product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       product_name VARCHAR(100),
       category VARCHAR(50),
       price DECIMAL(10, 2),
       stock INT
   );

   INSERT INTO products VALUES
   (1, 'Laptop', 'Electronics', 55000, 12),
   (2, 'Mouse', 'Electronics', 700, 150),
   (3, 'Keyboard', 'Electronics', 1200, 90),
   (4, 'T-Shirt', 'Fashion', 500, 40),
   (5, 'Jeans', 'Fashion', 1500, 25),

   (10, 'Rice Bag', 'Grocery', 900, 60);
   ```

4. **Run the queries**
   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p store_db < "Ishika Dubey sql assignment.sql"
   ```

## 💡 Sample Queries

### Example 1: Get Electronics Products
```sql
-- Retrieve all electronics products
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Electronics';
```

### Example 2: Find Products by Price Range
```sql
-- Products priced between 500 and 5000
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price BETWEEN 500 AND 5000;
```

### Example 3: Pattern Matching
```sql
-- Products whose name contains 'oo'
SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_name LIKE '%oo%';
```

### Example 4: Top 5 Most Expensive Products
```sql
-- Get the 5 most expensive items
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 5;
```

### Example 5: Advanced Filtering
```sql
-- Electronics with stock < 50 and price > 3000
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE category = 'Electronics' 
  AND stock < 50 
  AND price > 3000 
ORDER BY product_name ASC;
```
